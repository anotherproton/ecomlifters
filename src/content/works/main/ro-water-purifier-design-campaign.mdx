<Statement title="Problem Statement" description="Consumers see water purifiers as boring appliances. We needed to shift that perception — presenting this RO system as an essential lifestyle product that blends modern tech with health-first aesthetics."/>
<img className="w-full" alt="Result-image" src="/assets/imgs/works/2.png" /> 
### Results & Metrics
We built a bold, water-centric theme around clarity and cleanliness. Using motion graphics, splash imagery, and a smart UI-led explainer, we positioned the purifier as a must-have for the new-age home.
